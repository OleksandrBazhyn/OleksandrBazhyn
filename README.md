## About me 🧑🏻‍💼
I am currently working as a Technical Support Manager, providing consultations for the most widely used commercial reporting software in Ukraine.
Alongside my client support duties, I am a member of the business process automation team and work as a developer, proactively designing and implementing automation solutions within my company.

I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, studying a wide range of mathematical and technical topics, while collaborating with many talented young professionals.

I love cooking at home. Since childhood, I have often ridden a bike and gone on cycling trips. I also really enjoy poetry and fishing. In my free time, apart from fishing, coding, and studying, I like watching movies and anime.
